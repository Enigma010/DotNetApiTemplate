# AppTests
The application's unit tests.

## Guidelines
The following describes guidelines for the architecture.

* Unit tests should be able to run and succeed with only the source code.  They should not rely on other infrastructure.
* Infrastructure can be simulated through the use of interfaces and mocking techniques.
* Unit tests need to be run to be effective.
* Unit tests must always succeed unless there is problem with the application.
* Unit tests that are not reliable need to be, rewritten or removed. Unit test failures must be trusted to show actual issues with the system.
* Unit tests should be run periodically during development. 
* No code should be committed until all unit tests are succeeding.
* Unit test code coverage should maintain the agreed upon coverage percentage.

## Unit Tests
Unit tests can be run from within the Visual Studio **Test Explorer**.  

## Test Coverage
The test coverage report can be generated by opening a **WSL** command prompt and going into the **AppTests** directory and typing the command:

```
./lrun.sh
```

The coverage report can be found <a href="./coveragereport/index.html">here</a>.
